I am a Full-Stack Software Developer who recently made a life switch from fashion into the world of coding.

After spending four years working as a fashion designer and buyer I found there weren't the challenges I was seeking. I realised I enjoyed solving problems and also love creating new things, so I began UX Design study in my spare time. Soon I discovered the endless and full of possibilities programming world is my true interest, which also brings me the chance to combine my creativity and problem solving skills. Since then I haven't looked back and I canâ€™t wait to learn something new about this every day. I am looking for a diverse and innovative environment to further my study and bring ideas to to life.


## Skills

#### Problem solving

In my previous buying role, my main responsibility was liaising with clients and manufactures to make sure the entire process is going smoothly, which required strong problem solving skill, as sometimes working with less experienced manufactures, you will never know what is the next challenging matter you are going to confront. So the ability of breaking down tough issues, quick decision making and considerate plan making has been developed over the time.
