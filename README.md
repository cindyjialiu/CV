I am a Full-Stack Software Developer who recently made a life switch from fashion into the world of coding.

After spending four years working as a fashion designer and buyer I was ready for a new world of challenges with more uncertainty and creativity. I knew that I enjoyed solving problems and also love creating new things, and after trying UX Design, I discovered my true interest is the endless and full of possibilities programming world. Since then I haven't looked back and regardless of the ups and downs I can’t wait to learn something new about this every day.

Along with the technical side, something I have found especially interesting is how people relate to software development.  I have heard the expression “there’s more than one way to skin a cat” and it seems that applies more than ever in software development.  Software is as much about computers as architecture is about buildings - actually it’s how people use them that is important.

I'd like to work at a diverse and innovative environment where I can learn a lot to further my study and bring ideas to life.

## Skills

#### Problem solving / Great communication
<!--
Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed. -->

As a buyer, I made sure everything was going well with both clients and suppliers. Due to price constraints, many of the people involved were inexperienced which meant I needed to get to the bottom of emerging issues and solve them before they had an impact. As a result I have already developed the ability to break down tough issues, make decisions and carry out plans quickly that take others’ needs into account in order to keep a good relationship.

In one case I was leading a team of two and showed my colleague when and how to organise a container delivery.  Unfortunately she forgot to check everything correctly, meaning one week before the ship date the container was only part full.  As an immediate fix I got one of our regular suppliers to fill the space with stock items, and to solve the underlying problem and improve communication I created a container checklist to prevent similar issues in future.

#### Fast, independent learner

At the start of December 2017 I had zero knowledge of programming, then I taught myself Ruby basics in less than 2 months in order to solve simple programming challenges.

During the 16 week course at Makers, I've learnt how the full stack development process works, which includes a series of programming languages, testing frameworks, libraries, database and a few tools of deployment. I've successfully built a numbers of applications, including the clone version of twitter and Instagram from scratch while I was learning.  I always want to understand the reasoning fully before moving on, this means I’ve become a key helper for many fellow students.

#### Great collaborator
I highly believe great team work plays a key role of achieving tasks in an efficient way.

During our final project at Makers, I always helped and explained all the team members for the questions or any unclear points they had and made sure everyone understood all the work we did properly. I have been highly complimented on being a super patient team player.

#### Attention to details

I have been told many times by my previous colleagues and managers that I have very good eyes on details, which really helped me on minimise the risk on many projects.

During one of the group projects at Makers, we encountered an unclear error issue from deployment and after a couple of days hard working on fixing, it started working. But as we were all at junior level and none of us was really clear on how things work behind the scene. I decided to look into more details and gain better understandings, I realised actually  someone turned a core test checking setting off to avoid the error message and the real issue wasn't that.
