I am a Full-Stack Software Developer who recently made a life switch from fashion into the world of coding.

After spending four years working as a fashion designer and buyer I was ready for a new world of challenges with more uncertainty and creativity. I knew that I enjoyed solving problems and also love creating new things, and after trying UX Design, I discovered my true interest is the endless and full of possibilities programming world. Since then I haven't looked back and regardless of the ups and downs I can’t wait to learn something new about this every day.

Along with the technical side, something I have found especially interesting is how people relate to software development.  I have heard the expression “there’s more than one way to skin a cat” and it seems that applies more than ever in software development.  Software is as much about computers as architecture is about buildings - actually it’s how people use them that is important.

I'd like to work at a diverse and innovative environment where I can learn lot to further my study and bring ideas to life.

## Skills

#### Problem solving
<!--

In my previous buying role, my main responsibility was liaising with clients and manufacturers to make sure the entire process is going smoothly, which requires strong problem solving skill, as sometimes working with less experienced manufacturers, anything can happen without warning. So the ability of breaking down tough issues, quick decision making and considerate plan making has been developed over the time.
